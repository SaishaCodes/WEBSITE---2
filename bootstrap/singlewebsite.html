The exterior is adorned with vibrant blooms and twinkling fairy lights, giving it a warm and enchanting glow. Inside, Tinkerbell's house is a treasure trove of tiny, handcrafted furniture and delightful trinkets. The main living area features a comfortable leaf hammock and a delicate flower petal rug, creating a cozy spot for relaxation. Shelves lined with jars of pixie dust and various tools hint at Tinkerbell's love for tinkering and inventing. A small, perfectly rounded window lets in streams of sunlight, illuminating the room with a soft, golden light.
